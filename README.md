# DNA-Art
DNA-Art generates images from artificial DNA sequences using React, Flask, Perplexity Sonar, and Gemini Flash 2.0. We overcame challenges in genetic parsing and AI integration, gaining skills in real-time models. Future plans include training with real DNA for realistic, research-focused visuals.
